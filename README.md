# Operations_Research_Project
A company must locate deposits on the national territory.
Deposits must cover the entire national territory. Considering an Italian population of about 60 
million inhabitants, each deposit cannot serve more than 5 million people.
Given this generic scenario (but any other territory can be chosen), the work involves:
1) Identify a company and a real application scenario, adhering to the general scenario for 
which to decline the project.
2) Describe in detail the identified scenario.
3) Design and implement a mathematical programming model capable of solving the given 
problem or its simplification.
4) Develop a heuristic approach to the problem.
5) Develop a meta-heuristic approach to the problem.
6) Create several instances to test the developed approaches.
7) Carry out computational tests starting from the identified test cases.
8) Comment the results.
9) The report describing the work done cannot exceed 10 pages.
The project is considered sufficient even if all the required approaches are not implemented. 
To aim for the highest grade, however, it is necessary to implement an exact approach, a heuristic 
approach and a meta-heuristic approach, using both Excel and/or Python for the various 
techniques

1)Heuristics
2)P-median 
3)Genetic Algorithm
